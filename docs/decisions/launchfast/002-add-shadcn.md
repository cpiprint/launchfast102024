# Addition of shadcn/ui Components

Date: 2024-07-04

Status: accepted

## Context

The original Epic Stack includes only a handful of components, which can limit
developers' ability to quickly build out their applications. To align with
LaunchFast's principle of Comprehensive Inclusivity to provide everything needed
to hit the ground running, we decided to include a comprehensive set of
components from shadcn/ui.

## Decision

We have integrated the complete set of shadcn/ui components into LaunchFast.
This provides developers with a rich library of ready-to-use components,
reducing the need to build basic UI elements from scratch and accelerating the
development process.

## Consequences

- **Enhanced Component Library**: Developers have access to a wider range of
  components, making it easier to build complex UIs quickly.
- **Consistency and Quality**: shadcn/ui components are well-designed and
  tested, ensuring a consistent and high-quality user interface.
- **Initial Setup Time**: With more components readily available, the initial
  setup time for developing new features is significantly reduced.

## Context

To assist developers in transitioning from the exploration phase to a public
release, we identified the need for a comprehensive guide that outlines
essential steps for preparing a web app for production. This guide aims to
provide clear, actionable instructions, ensuring that developers can efficiently
ready their applications for public use.

## Decision

We have created a guide titled "Preparing Your Web App for Public Release" that
provides step-by-step instructions for critical tasks necessary to prepare a web
app for public deployment. The guide includes detailed instructions on various
tasks, such as:

- Updating logos and icons
- Configuring email
- Setting up analytics and monitoring
- Implementing security best practices
- Setting up custom domains
- Configuring zero-downtime deployments

Additionally, the guide provides access to a Figma file that users can utilize
to create and export their logos (for both dark and light themes) and all the
icons they need for their application.

## Consequences

- **Streamlined Launch Process**: Developers can efficiently prepare their
  applications for public release by following the comprehensive steps provided
  in the guide.
- **Enhanced Branding**: The guide helps ensure that logos and icons are
  properly updated and integrated.
- **Improved Security**: Enabling and configuring the Content Security Policy
  enhances the security of the application.
- **Custom Domain Integration**: Instructions for connecting custom domains
  ensure that the application is accessible via a personalized URL.
- **Email Setup**: Detailed instructions help developers set up critical
  functionalities like email.

By following this guide, developers will ensure their web app is fully prepared
for public release. Future updates to the guide will incorporate new best
practices and tools to maintain its relevance and value.

This decision supports our goal of providing a robust and user-friendly toolkit
that not only aids in building applications but also ensures they are ready for
production deployment.

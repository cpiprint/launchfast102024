# Decision Documentation

This documentation outlines the architectural and implementation decisions made
for the LaunchFast stack.

## Inherited Decisions

Decisions inside the `inherited` folder were made by Kent C. Dodds for the Epic
Stack (a fork of the Indie Stack created by the Remix team), which LaunchFast
forks. These decisions have been reviewed and adopted for LaunchFast due to
their relevance and effectiveness.

## LaunchFast Decisions

LaunchFast follows different principles from those outlined in the Epic Stack.
As LaunchFast evolves, it will naturally deviate more and more from the Epic
Stack. These deviations and any enhancements to our approach will result in
specific decisions, which will be documented in the /launchfast folder. This
ensures that users can see the decision-making process specific to LaunchFast
and understand how and why it differs from the Epic Stack over time.

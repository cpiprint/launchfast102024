# Decisions

This directory contains all the decisions made for LaunchFast and serves as a
record for understanding the rationale behind those decisions. While the
decisions documented here are not final and may evolve, these documents provide
a clear explanation for why specific choices were made. They are intended to
help anyone quickly understand the reasoning behind our decisions.

## Folder Structure

- **/inherited**: This folder contains decisions made by Kent C. Dodds for the
  Epic Stack. These decisions have been reviewed and adopted for LaunchFast due
  to their relevance and effectiveness.
- **/launchfast**: This folder contains decisions made specifically for
  LaunchFast. These decisions reflect the unique goals and principles of
  LaunchFast and may deviate from the inherited decisions as necessary.

By organizing the decisions in this manner, we maintain transparency and
clarity, making it easy to differentiate between the original decisions from the
Epic Stack and the new decisions made for LaunchFast.

In keeping with the [guiding principle](guiding-principles.md) to "Minimize
Setup Friction," there are some things that may be pretty common for web
applications to do but aren't common enough to be included in LaunchFast.

This page links to examples of how to implement some things with the LaunchFast
stack. While these examples are based on the Epic Stack, they might still be
useful for LaunchFast users.

For the original examples and more details, please refer to the
[Epic Stack Examples](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/blob/main/docs/examples.md).

## How to contribute

Watch:
[Contribute an Epic Stack Example](https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/contribute-an-epic-stack-example)

Although the video is by Kent C. Dodds and focuses on the Epic Stack, the
principles and steps described are equally applicable to contributing examples
for the LaunchFast stack. You don't need permission to contribute an example.
Feel free to create your repository based on LaunchFast and add whatever you
like for your example. Here are some tips:

1. Create an `init` commit as soon as you generate the project, before you make
   any changes. That way people can look at the commit history of your example
   and see what you've added.
2. Update the `README.md` with some information about what your example is about
   and call out any interesting things you've done.
3. Add the tags "launch-fast" and "launch-fast-example" so it will appear on
   [this page on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/launch-fast-example).
4. It's not normally necessary to deploy your example to production (simply
   comment out the deployment part of the GitHub workflow), but you can if you
   like.

Once you've made your repo, simply open a pull request to this page and add your
example to the bottom of the list with a brief description.
